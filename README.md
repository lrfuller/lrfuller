My name is Lukas Fuller, I'm a front end web developer with the desire to learn more front-end or back-end technologies.

I have 2 projects I'm looking to do hopefully soon:
1) Portfolio website hosted with one of my PCs
2) Create an api, possibly used for an app, that will find a random question that will help you get to know your family better. Researching now.
